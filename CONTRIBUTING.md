# Contributing to WooCommerce Synchrotron

Thanks for your interest in our "Synchrotron" project!

This is an exciting new way of working within wp-admin for WooCommerce and we're
glad you're here! Right now the status of this plugin is still fairly new and
because of that, we're still sort of making things up as we go along, so expect
to see things be in a state of flux for a while.

If you're looking to help, you can by:
 * Trying out the code
 * Reporting issues
 * Sharing your thoughts or suggestions
 * Fixing issues

## GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs, questions, and suggestions. If you have
something important,
[open an issue.](https://github.com/Automattic/wc-synchrotron/issues/new)

If you are reporting a bug, first please make sure you're up to date
and running the newest code! This repo is changing very quickly right now.
Also, a quick search through the existing issues to see if it's already
been reported is very helpful to reduce duplicates.

If you're sure you're running the latest code, then create the issue and:
 * Describe what's happening.
 * List the steps you took to experience the issue.
 * Describe your environment ( WooCommerce version, WordPress version, etc.)

## Getting Started

If you're ready to get started trying out Synchrotron, visit the
[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Automattic/wc-synchrotron/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Working in the Code

If you're wanting to start working with the code, make sure to read the
[Collaborator Guidelines](COLLABORATORS.md)
before you start, so you can make sure your PR fits our standards before you
submit it!

## We're Here To Help

This is a very new project, so things are still shifting around a bit as we
get the code settled. If you have a question, just create an issue and tag it
with the "question" tag.
